Q>	How do I change themes?
A>	There is a section in your Preferences page that allows you to change your site theme. Please preview the theme first as some older themes are no longer compatible and could render your site unusable if applied.

Q>	What's COPPA?
A>	The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. It's a univarsally used rule that protects minors aged 13 and under. It ensures that no information on minors will be used by the 'Operator' (ie, you) for purposes other than maintaining the website. For more information please see http://www.cdt.org/legislation/105th/privacy/coppa.html.

Q>	What's flood protextion?
A>	It prevents your site being flooded by HTTP calls, which can render your site unreachable.

Q>	Should I use Cookies or Sessions for tracking my users?
A>	It's your choice, if your site is working ok with cookies (the default) then leave it like that. If you prefer to use PHP sessions, then use that (a custom session handler is used by e107 to store and handle sessions).
