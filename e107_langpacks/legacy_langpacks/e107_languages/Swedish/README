*** This is a convertion straight up from my UTF-8 encoded files

*** does not work as expected!

This language pack is under development at the moment, and by that
in no way complete as of now.

Files will be added to the CVS as they become ready for beta use.
Keep your eyes on the CHANGELOG for information on language files
and the status of them.

In the CHANGELOG, files will be listed when they have been tested
as functional and proof-read for grammar and correctness.

If you want to contribute, feel free to send me any pointers, any
completely translated files or anything else you feel like should
be included/changed.
