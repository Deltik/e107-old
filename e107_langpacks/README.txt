When translating language packs for e107, please make sure you save with a utf-8 encoding. 
Notepad.exe on WinXP will allow you to save as UTF-8. 

Note: Notepad may add strange characters before "<?php" . These should be removed after
you have finished your translation, using a php editor in ANSI mode. eg. Notepad+++, editplus etc.
