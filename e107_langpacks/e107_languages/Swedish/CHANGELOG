Changelog for the Swedish Language pack:

Sat Feb 25 2006 - mrpiercer (at) users.sourceforge.net
- Uppdated to e107 v0.7.2 RELEASE. Both UTF-8 och
 ISO8859-1 has the same content and release status.
Tue Jan 24 2006 - mrpiercer (at) users.sourceforge.net
- Updated to todays CVS code, which should be the e107
  v0.7.1 RELEASE.
Sat Sep 17 2005 - mrpiercer (at) users.sourceforge.net
- Updated to today's CVS code status. I'm putting up
  a test suite for the ISO encoded files in legacy_langpacks
  for anyone to test with.
Wed Jul 7 2005 - mrpiercer (at) users.sourceforge.net
- Seems like things are looking okay now, so from now on
  I'll focus on keeping up with the developers changes.
Wed Jun 22 2005 - mrpiercer (at) users.sourceforge.net
- The documentation files in ~/e107_docs/help/Swedish
  cannot have Swedish characters like åäö in them, this
  because there is no translation table between menu choices
  and file names.  The file name turns into the menu selection
  entry, and since all installations of a webserver on
  different platforms has a different file system character
  encoding, the filenames are restricted to the basic characters.
Tue Jun 21 2005 - mrpiercer (at) users.sourceforge.net
- Now all the core files are updated to correspond to CVS
  version 2005-06-16.
Mon Jun 13 2005 - mrpiercer (at) users.sourceforge.net
- Every file is now very rougly translated. Next step is to
  verify them on a live site, and one by one correct all
  mistakes in spelling, grammar and plain language use.
Wed Jun 1 2005 - mrpiercer (at) users.sourceforge.net
- Commited language files for the themes currently in the
  CVS; crahan, e107v4, human_condition, interfectus, jayya,
  kubrick, lamb, sebes and vekna_blue.
Wed Jun 1 2005 - mrpiercer (at) users.sourceforge.net
- All files in the e107_languages/Swedish directory and
  its subdirectories are now rougly translated and commited.
  Please do comment on them! Nothing is read for correctness
  and/or grammar yet. Primarilly I'm focusing on commiting
  all files.
Mon May 30 2005 - mrpiercer (at) users.sourceforge.net
- Added a file SVENSKA.INFO in Swedish language. This file
  is used for findings and questions about Swedish grammar
  and language correctness
Mon May 30 2005 - mrpiercer (at) users.sourceforge.net
- Initial CVS commit of partial package.
