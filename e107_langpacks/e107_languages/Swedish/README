README for the Swedish language pack for e107.
README för det svenska språkpaketet till e107.

With respect for the non-Swedish users who wish to use this
language package, all documentation files will be written in Egnlish.

Med respekt för icke-Svenska användare kommer alla dokumentationsfiler
att vara skrivna på Engelska.

-------------

This language pack is corresponding to the e107 v0.7.1 RELEASE
at the moment, and by that only grammar and spelling changes
should be required as of now.

Keep your eyes on the CHANGELOG for information on language files
and the status of them.

In the CHANGELOG, files will be listed when they have been tested
as functional and proof-read for grammar and correctness.

If you want to contribute, feel free to send me any pointers, any
completely translated files or anything else you feel like should
be included/changed.

Regards,
mrpiercer at users.sourceforge.net
